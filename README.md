# ETL of German Air Assessment Methods and Prediction of pollutant as aerosol. 

Different Air assessment methods of pollutants in the air across Germany from 1975 to 2019 is obtained from [European Environment Agency](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/aqereporting-8/emetadata/european-2014-metadata).
The obtained raw data is filtered for German region. Later the data is pre-processed and wrangled to form a star scheme database structure. 

## Objective
Generate a star scheme of air assessment methods and predict whether the pollutant being assessed is present as an aerosol depending on the stationâ€™s geographical characteristics and the method employed to assess the pollutant.
